title: Uncheck the deal between Google and Adblock Plus

I sure do hate advertisements. However, I really don't like when I've
installed a add-on and now I'm still seeing ads! I was really happy
with it and recently I did a search and noticed the top results had
sponsored results. Lame.

Double check; Yup, I'm running Adblock Plus. It's enabled. The filters
are setup with three different popular lists. When I search I am overwhelmed
with articles about a "backdoor" deal with Google and the creators of
Adblock Plus. I actually don't have much problem with them promoting acceptable
guidelines of advertisements, because it's not the core concept of advertising I
am entirely against, it's the current implementation.

Well, folks, the answer is absurdly easy. If you're running Adblock Plus already
and you're getting the sponsored search results, open your Adblock filter settings
and make sure the "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" is **unchecked**.

Happy searching!
