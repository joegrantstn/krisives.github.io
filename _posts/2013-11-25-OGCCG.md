title: OGCCG - An Open Generic Collectible Card Game

If you've ever used GCCG<sup>1</sup> then you know it could use some love. If you
have no idea what I'm talking about, that's a Collectible Card Game (CCG) engine,
like Magic: The Gathering (MTG) and Pokemon. The idea is once you make an app
for playing cards, anyone can make a set of rules or cards to play other games
instead of writing a separate app for each card game. That's awesome!

While awesome, over time GCCG has had less love and grown a bit moldy:

* GCCG is an older SDL application. In general, for a card game it's quite
heavy and can be slow

* Hosting tables requires setting up a server with command-line knowledge

* Requires a binary executable to play even if not hosting a server

* Runs perl internally

* Stores card data in XML


There are some more problems with GCCG, but these are the main issues. It has a lot
of general User Interface (UI) issues with it as well. The UI issues are troubling
because the application is built with a combination of C/C++, SDL, and Perl code. Fixing
and implementing UI changes is tedious.

## Presenting OGCCG

OGCCG is a project I started to continue on the spirit of GCCG while
starting a new codebase. This has many benefits:

* Uses HTML5 front-end for UI. This makes it easy to customize and
add features without manually coding many things.

* PHP for a light server. This lets people avoid downloading the server
so friends can play with each other (only one needs a server)

* No binary required unless you want to run a server node

* Download data over BitTorrent (optional)

* Connect to global card network using Tor (optional)

The basic idea is to re-create the GCCG wheel, but it's a very modern and spiffy
wheel! Work right now is in the core engine of playing games, moving things around,
etc. However, many full card games have been played and many features are implemented. Lot's
of work is ahead, but here are some details about the current implementation some of which
I imagine will not change.

## Synchronizing Events

At the core of any multiplayer game is the problem of synchronization: how do all the players
in the game agree on what is happening? The state of the objects individually and the game state
as a whole have to match. If a player says a card is tapped, other players need to know it's
tapped.

That sounds simple, and to some degree it is. With the tapping a card example, imagine you
tap a card and around the same time another player does as well. On your screen the card
is tapped, and on theirs it may not be due to lag. What happens when they tap the untapped
card?

There are a couple of ways this could work out:

* A poorly written game would essentially de-synchronize because the order of events
in the game no longer match. Some players will see a tapped card others will see an
untapped card unless they can all reload the game and resume the same game state

* An inefficient game won't care and will just spam the most recent command. In this case whoever
tapped the card last would set the card as either tapped or untapped. On your screen this
would cause the card to remain tapped, and you would never know the other player tapped
the card. (They tapped an untapped card just like you did)

* A good game will perform the game events in the same order for all players. We can't
magically fix the lag (although, we can help compensate for it) but most importantly
all players see the same game state. Tapping the card caused it tap, and the next player
untapped it. All players would see the tap and untap.

I spent a lot of time thinking about this because I wanted to make sure this fundamental
doesn't change later in the project. What I decided was to have the game server control
the order of events. Every event in the game occurs in a specific order. When a user does
something they send that event to the server and temporarily apply the effects of that
event until the game server responds with the new events.

For example assume you tap a card. The card tapped is displayed as tapped on your screen,
but it's not really tapped yet until the 'tap' event comes from the server. The gap between
when the server responds with the events you actually did is the lag time. In practice it
works great. Some edge cases exist when you're adding counters though.

## What OGCCG looks like

## What is next for OCCG?

There are a lot of things that need to happen before the code can be of any use
to others:

* I started from the GCCG card data. I need to test the scripts I originally
made and make sure they convert the XML data into the database

* Setup process for starting out of the box

* Global network via Tor (more on this later)
