At least 30K viewers watching the ESL tournament finals today were cut off while the
Steam network went down. Ironically I was going to play a game of CS:GO but when I saw
Steam I began doing other things, then noticed it had been down for over an hour and went
to /r/globaloffensive - which reminded me of the ESL Katowice finals being today.

When I tuned into the Stream they had a rather depressing "waiting for steam to no
be down" text, and casting personality "Anders" was forced to relay less than
amazing news to fans:

    "We don't have much more than advertisements and music at the moment. I am sorry for that"
    - Anders

Being straight-up about it:

    "I am playing Sandstorm while Steam is down in an attempt to distract everyone from realizing
    the stream has been playing music for over an hour"
    - Anders

Right as saving this article Steam began to come online and it appears it was a horribly
timed update to the platform. My guess is that CS:GO works with Katowice and other tournament
providers, but there is a gap between someone and the core Steam team. You can probably assume
it was not some DDoS.
