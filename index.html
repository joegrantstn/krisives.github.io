	<p id="about">
		This is where I keep the codes
	</p>
	
	<h1>Current Focus</h1>
	<h2><a href="/onebigchessboard">OneBigChessBoard</a></h2>
	<p>
		While playing chess, Steven and I came up with an idea to create
		a massively multiplayer chess board game.
	</p>
	
	<h2>BrainPHP</h2>
	<p>
		A port of <code>brain</code> from JavaScript to PHP I wrote so I can take
		over the world. Not only did my employer not fire me for working on this
		project, but they actually encouraged it! As the original, the PHP port
		is released under a BSD-like license.
	</p>
	
	<h1>Other Projects</h1>
	<h2><a href="https://github.com/krisives/PHParcel">PHParcel</a></h2>
	<p>
		An abstract shipping API written in 2007 to manage UPS, DHL, and
		others. While originally written for PEAR it has since been
		used standalone. It works for PHP 5+
	</p>
	
	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<p>
		Believe it or not a lot of people follow up and ask me what I'm doing.
		Usually when I'm slacking on a side project due to time constraints.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Why did you take your site (santiance.com) down?</h2>
	<p>
		At first it was a minor technical issue, but then I realized
		how little spare time I had to manage it and the lack of
		benefits it brought. Upon inception it was quite useful to have,
		but over time various services and sites have replaced it
	</p>
	
	<h2>Why are you not working on <a href="http://www.emotiv.com/store/hardware/epoc-bci-eeg/developer-neuroheadset/">Epoc Headset</a> stuff?</h2>
	<p>
		I published a well-received article about integrating various Open Source
		software, and even stepped up to do it myself as I have worked with the
		Compiz team before.
	</p>
	<p>
		As of 2011 Emotiv still has not delivered a Linux SDK. While I could grab
		the Windows SDK and use a VM with USB device filtering, do I really think
		end users are ever going to do that? Hell no!
	</p>
	
	<h2>Are you currently employed?</h2>
	<p>
		Yes. I currently work as a software engineer in Oregon. I
		manage an infastructure of over 200 retailer websites. On any
		given day I implement new features, fix bugs, patch
		security holes, and managing the version control of it all.
