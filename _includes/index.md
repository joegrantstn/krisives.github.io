### Who are you?
My name is Kris, you might know me as:

* Kristopher, a guy that lives in Oregon

* Software developer at Gearbox Studios

* Bitcoin consultant / contractor

* Amateur paintball player

* I play games and help run tournaments (Counter-Strike and Starcraft)

### What do you do?

I write code. A lot of it. Not all of it ends up making the cut, but I've
been programming for... *let me see here* Damn, about 16 years now. For a list
of projects I've made and a better idea of what I'm doing right now, go check
out my [GitHub repos](https://github.com/krisives).

### How can I get in contact with you?

The fastest and easiest way to reach me would be:

* Send an e-mail to [kristopher.ives@gmail.com](mailto:kristopher.ives@gmail.com)

* Tweet [@KristopherIves](https://twitter.com/KristopherIves)

I'm still getting a decent handle on setting up my BitMessage addresses,
and I will post those here soon.
